          We made this because we wanted a service that we would trust
          with our own passwords and sensitive messages, and sending them via
          email makes us nervous.

          %p 
            We’ve made this project open source so you can examine how it works
            and feel confident in using it. For the daring or truly paranoid,
            you could even host it yourself.
