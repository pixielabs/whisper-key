# WhisperKey.io

This is the repository for [WhisperKey](https://www.whisperkey.io).

WhisperKey uses public-key cryptography to securely encrypt and decrypt
messages without the unencrypted content or security keys ever leaving your
machine.

We made this because we wanted a service that we would trust with our own
passwords and sensitive messages, and sending them via email makes us nervous.
